# qNOXify

qNOXify is a qBittorernt Thin Client for windows created by [L.Meyer](qNOXify@ea4d.com). It is developed with Delphi Community Edition 11.3 (Pascal) and based on [qBit4Delphi](https://github.com/bnzbnz/qBit4Delphi) work. Ideal for NOX (headless qBittorrent) users who want to take control of their servers right from the desktop.

## Run
Execute qNOXify.exe . You may get a SmartScreen warning the first time... just run... (or build from source if you want to make sure :) )
  
## Build
In order to build qNOXify, you'll have to execute, first, qBit4Delphi\patcher.exe (again SmartScreen or run from source). Il will generate the necessary modified json units matching your Delphi version.

You shoud be good to go...
